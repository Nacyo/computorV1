# ComputorV1

### Objective
The goal of this project is to create a program to solve simple equations.
The program will take a polynomial equation of degree inferior or equal to 2 as a parameter. That is, only using
powers, no complicated functions. The program will have to display its solution(s).
We are forbidden to use mathematical functions/libraries that we did not implement.

We must at least display :
- The reduced form of the equation.
- The degree of the equation.
- Its solution(s), as well as the sign of the discriminant when it makes sense.

### Usage

`python3 computorv1.py "polynomial equation"`
 
e.g: 

`python3 computorv1.py "5 + 3 * X + 3 * X^2 = X^2 + 0 * X"`
